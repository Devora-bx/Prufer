# Animated Pr端fer Code to Tree Conversion

This project visualizes the step-by-step process of converting a Pr端fer sequence to a tree. It uses `networkx` and `matplotlib` to build and visualize the tree dynamically based on user input.

## Features
- **Interactive Input**: Users can input a Pr端fer sequence via a text box.
- **Step-by-Step Visualization**: The tree is built one edge at a time, showing each step of the construction process.
- **Graphical Representation**: Uses `networkx` for graph representation and `matplotlib` for visualization.

## Project Structure
- `tree_builder.py`: Contains the main logic to convert the Pr端fer sequence to a tree and build it step by step.
- `visualization.py`: Handles the visualization, drawing the tree after each step.
- `main.py`: The main script that sets up the user interface with a text box for input and runs the visualization.
